4. Navigate to the SQL Injection vulnerability page.
5. Enter the following sql command: `1' OR '1'='1` in user id section.
6. You should be returned a long list of users and their passowords â€” this indicates that the SQL injection exploit worked.
7. you can even try other advanced sql command: `1' UNION SELECT null, version()-- -` or something along those lines to display the database version.
